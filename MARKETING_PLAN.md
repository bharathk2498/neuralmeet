## WEEK 1: PRE-LAUNCH (DAYS 1-7)

### Goal: 50 Email Signups

### LinkedIn Content Strategy

Day 1: Problem Statement
"I spent 23 hours in meetings this week. 15 of them could have been emails. The other 8 I was completely unprepared for. This needs to change."

Day 2: Personal Story
"Last month, I walked into a board meeting having forgotten the entire context from our Q3 discussion. I had the transcript somewhere but no time to read 10,000 words. That was my breaking point."

Day 3: Solution Tease
"What if AI could read every meeting transcript you've ever had and give you a 2-minute brief before your next one? I'm building this. Launching next week."

Day 4: Behind the Scenes
"Building in public: Just integrated OpenAI GPT-4 with Fireflies to automatically generate meeting prep documents. Testing with my own meetings first. Results are incredible."

Day 5: Value Proposition
"The average exec makes $200k/year and spends 23 hours/week in meetings. That's $115,000 in meeting time annually. What if you could cut that by 50% and still show up better prepared?"

Day 6: Beta Announcement
"NeuralMeet launches Monday. First 25 people get lifetime discount. AI-powered meeting prep that saves 15 minutes per meeting. Comment 'interested' for early access."

Day 7: Final Push
"24 hours until launch. Here's what NeuralMeet does: 1) Connects to your meetings 2) Reads every transcript 3) Generates prep brief before each meeting 4) You show up prepared, every time. Link in comments."

### Reddit Strategy

Target Subreddits:
- r/Entrepreneur
- r/startups
- r/ProductManagement
- r/SaaS
- r/digitalnomad

Post Type: Value-first, not promotional

Example Post for r/ProductManagement:
"How do you prepare for meetings with 50+ stakeholders?"
Share your meeting prep workflow and struggles in comments, mention you're working on a solution if asked.

### Cold Email Campaign

Send to 50 targeted executives found on LinkedIn

Subject Line Options:
- "23 hours/week in meetings?"
- "Walk into every meeting prepared"
- "Meeting prep in 2 minutes instead of 30"

Email Template:
```
Hi [First Name],

I noticed you're leading [team size] at [company]. With that many direct reports, I'm guessing you're in 15-20 meetings per week.

Quick question: How much time do you spend preparing for meetings vs actually being in them?

Most executives I talk to spend 30+ minutes prepping for important meetings, reviewing notes, searching old emails, trying to remember context.

I built a tool that does this in 2 minutes. It reads all your meeting transcripts and generates a brief with:
- Key points from last discussion
- Outstanding action items
- Decision history
- Recommended talking points

Currently testing with 10 beta users. Would you be open to trying it?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. - It's free during beta, and I genuinely want feedback from busy executives like yourself.
```

Follow-up if no response after 3 days:
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my message about meeting prep automation.

I know your time is valuable (probably why you need this tool!), so I'll be direct:

NeuralMeet saves 15 minutes per meeting by auto-generating prep briefs from transcripts.

Beta is free. Takes 5 minutes to set up. Worth a try?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```
