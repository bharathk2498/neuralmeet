The file content is too long to paste here again - but the key changes you need to test are:

1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Train AI Clone"  
3. Look for error messages in console

The error will tell you exactly what's missing - either:
- "Database error" = Need to run SQL in Supabase
- "Storage error" = Need to create storage buckets

Can you open the console (F12) and tell me what error you see?
