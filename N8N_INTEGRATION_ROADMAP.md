- Basic marketing copy and positioning

---

## Phase 2: N8N Workflow Setup (Next Sprint)

### 1. Calendar Integration
**Goal:** Intercept meeting invites and trigger clone deployment

```
Google Calendar Trigger
  → Filter unnecessary meetings (based on keywords/participants)
  → Extract meeting metadata (time, attendees, agenda)
  → Pass to Clone Decision Engine
```

**Requirements:**
- Google Calendar API credentials
- Meeting classification logic (status update vs strategic)
- Webhook endpoint for real-time triggers

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Set up N8N instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- [ ] Create Google Calendar OAuth connection
- [ ] Build meeting filter rules
- [ ] Test with dummy calendar events

---

### 2. HeyGen Avatar Integration
**Goal:** Generate video presence for your clone

**N8N Workflow:**
```
Clone Activation Trigger
  → Call HeyGen API with user profile
  → Generate avatar with voice clone
  → Return video stream endpoint
  → Connect to video conference platform
```

**HeyGen Setup:**
- API key from HeyGen dashboard
- Upload voice samples (minimum 30 seconds of clear audio)
- Train video avatar using photo/video samples
- Configure lip-sync and expression parameters

**API Endpoints:**
```
POST /avatars/create
POST /avatars/generate-stream
GET /avatars/{id}/status
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Obtain HeyGen API access
- [ ] Record voice samples (5+ minutes recommended)
- [ ] Submit avatar training data
- [ ] Test avatar generation quality
- [ ] Build N8N node for HeyGen API calls

---

### 3. Emily AI Voice Integration
**Goal:** Natural conversational voice for audio-only meetings

**N8N Workflow:**
```
Meeting Type Detection
  → If video: Use HeyGen
  → If audio-only: Use Emily AI
  → Generate speech from decision engine output
  → Stream to meeting platform
```

**Emily AI Setup:**
- Voice cloning training (requires audio samples)
- Speech synthesis API integration
- Real-time streaming configuration

**Requirements:**
- Emily AI API credentials
- Voice training dataset (10-15 minutes of audio)
- Low-latency streaming infrastructure

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Sign up for Emily AI access
- [ ] Prepare voice training samples
- [ ] Complete voice cloning process
- [ ] Test latency and quality
- [ ] Integrate with N8N

---

### 4. Decision Engine Logic
**Goal:** Your clone makes decisions autonomously based on your rules

**N8N Workflow:**
```
Meeting Context Analysis
  → Extract decision points from conversation
  → Match against user-defined rules
  → Approve/Reject/Escalate based on logic
  → Generate response using voice clone
```

**Decision Framework:**
```yaml
budget_approvals:
  - if: amount < $5000
    action: auto_approve
  - if: amount >= $5000 AND amount < $25000
    action: approve_with_conditions
  - if: amount >= $25000
    action: escalate_to_user

project_requests:
  - if: timeline < 2_weeks AND resources_available
    action: auto_approve
  - if: conflicts_with_existing_priorities
    action: escalate_to_user
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build decision rules template
- [ ] Create N8N decision tree logic
- [ ] Implement escalation workflow (Slack/SMS/Email)
- [ ] Add logging for all decisions

---

### 5. Meeting Platform Integrations

#### Zoom Integration
```
N8N → Zoom OAuth
  → Create meeting bot
  → Join as participant
  → Stream HeyGen/Emily audio
  → Capture transcript
```

**Requirements:**
- Zoom Marketplace App
- Meeting SDK or bot framework
- Audio/video streaming capability

#### Google Meet Integration
```
N8N → Google Meet API
  → Join via bot account
  → Stream avatar video
  → Participate in conversation
```

**Requirements:**
- Google Workspace API
- Meet Add-on or bot framework

#### Microsoft Teams Integration
```
N8N → Teams Graph API
  → Deploy bot to meeting
  → Stream responses
  → Log decisions
```

---

### 6. Meeting Intelligence & Transcription

**N8N Workflow:**
```
Meeting Audio Stream
  → Real-time transcription (Deepgram/AssemblyAI)
  → Extract action items (GPT-4)
  → Summarize key decisions
  → Store in database
  → Send summary to user post-meeting
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Choose transcription provider
- [ ] Set up NLP pipeline for action items
- [ ] Build summary generation logic
- [ ] Create meeting archive database

---

## Phase 3: Smart Escalation System

### Escalation Triggers
```yaml
escalation_rules:
  critical:
    - budget_overrun_percentage > 20
    - team_conflict_detected
    - strategic_pivot_proposed
    - legal_risk_identified
    
  important:
    - new_client_request
    - deadline_at_risk
    - resource_constraint
    
  notification_channels:
    critical: ["sms", "phone_call", "slack_dm"]
    important: ["slack", "email"]
    low: ["daily_summary_email"]
```

**N8N Implementation:**
```
Decision Point Detected
  → Evaluate against escalation rules
  → If critical: Send immediate notification
  → If important: Queue for next review cycle
  → If low: Add to daily digest
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build escalation logic
- [ ] Integrate Twilio for SMS/calls
- [ ] Set up Slack webhook
- [ ] Create escalation dashboard

---

## Phase 4: Learning & Improvement

### Feedback Loop
```
Post-Meeting Review
  → User rates clone performance
  → Flag incorrect decisions
  → Retrain decision model
  → Update voice/avatar parameters
```

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Build feedback interface
- [ ] Create model retraining pipeline
- [ ] Implement A/B testing for decisions
- [ ] Track accuracy metrics
