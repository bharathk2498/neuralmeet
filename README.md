# NeuralMeet

**Your AI Clone for Meetings. Stop Attending Meetings That Don't Need You.**

---

## üéØ Overview

NeuralMeet creates an AI clone that attends meetings on your behalf. It speaks with your voice, makes decisions using your logic, and only escalates when something truly requires your attention.

**Problem:** Executives waste 23 hours weekly in unnecessary meetings  
**Solution:** AI clone handles 67% of meetings autonomously  
**Result:** 1,200+ hours reclaimed annually per executive
